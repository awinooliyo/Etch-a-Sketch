# Dynamic Grid Project

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a dynamic grid of squares using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (An Odin Project task). The grid is generated dynamically, allowing users to specify the number of squares per side, and features interactive hover effects. Users can also resize the grid using a button that prompts for a new grid size.

## Features

- Create a grid with a user-specified number of squares per side.
- Hover effect: Each grid square changes color when the mouse hovers over it.
- Responsive grid size: Resize the grid dynamically based on user input.
- Maximum grid size is limited to 100 squares per side to ensure performance.
